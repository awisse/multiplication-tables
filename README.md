## What
This is a simple multiplication table quiz web app. Inspired by
[LucaRainone](https://github.com/LucaRainone/multiplication-tables-webapp).

[Demo](Not yet available)

## Why
I have two grandchildren in elementary school. I want to help them master the
multiplication tables up to 12.

## Contributing

Fixes and contributions are welcome

### Translations

Inside the `src/js/locale` directory there are the localized files. Use
the it.js file as a template and add your {langCode}.js file.

In order to see and build a localized version of the app, modify 
`src/js/locale/default.js` replacing the name of `it.js` with your
language.js.
